# Playworld RunnerUp

We created a prototype application to promote active children participation in playgrounds. It was made during a 24 hr hackathon called Bucknell Innovates held at Bucknell University and sponsored by [Novipod](https://novipod.com/), [Playworld](https://playworld.com/) and Entrepreneurship and Innovation House. Please feel free to check out our presentation [__here__](http://tinyurl.com/buckinnovates). We received the first prize for our hack.
